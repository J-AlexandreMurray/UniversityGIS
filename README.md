# Python Assignments
# University course work

# This is merely a series of project assignment snippets that I worked on for the university I attended as an Environmental Science/Geospatial Technology (GIS) student. 
# These assignments were done to help us further understand the Python programming language in relation to ArcMap/ArcGIS software. 

# Unfortunately, the majority of work done was through a virtual environment and I did not think to port it over to my PC at the time.
