# Python Assignments
# University course work

# This is merely a series of project assignment snippets that I worked on for the university I attended as an Environmental Science/Geospatial Technology (GIS) student. Unfortunately most (if not all) of our work was done via Virtual Environment to access ArcMap and QGIS so much of the data/code that I worked on was lost. 
# These assignments were done to help us further understand the Python programming language in relation to ArcMap/ArcGIS software through Arcpy.
